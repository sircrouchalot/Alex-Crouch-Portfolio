# UT-HW2-Responsive-Portfolio

# My webpage contains a navbar, but I couldn't figure out how to use bootstrap's navbar code and get it how I wanted it to look, so I created my own. Same with the footer.

# Each of my pages uses the bootstrap grid to align content, and some media queries to allow full responsiveness when the grid system was giving me trouble.

# I'm pretty happy with how it has generally turned out.
